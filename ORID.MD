**Objective:** Today, we focused on understanding and implementing the Three-Tier Architecture, emphasizing the separation of presentation, business logic, and data layers. Additionally, we practiced using Java JPA for efficient database interactions and explored its integration within the architecture.

**Reflective:** structured

**Interpretive:** The session highlighted the importance of a well-organized architectural approach for scalability and maintainability. Working with JPA provided hands-on experience with simplifying database operations while adhering to best practices for data access layers.

**Decision:** I plan to deepen my knowledge of JPA and refine my ability to design applications using the Three-Tier Architecture to build scalable and efficient systems.
